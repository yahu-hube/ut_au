THE TITLE STANDS FOR UNDERTALE ALTERNATE UNIVERSE
(i'm not a profesianal, just doing it for fun, BUT I DO NEED COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS)
Not sure how to do a real license, i'm 11. BUT i do have something to say. You maybe need to download pygame library first to run the files. If you don't need it tell me. i'll do a propper lisence
when this game is becoming bigger & larger. And 1 more thing: LOTS OF COMMENTS PLEASE I REALLY NEED THEM. 
LISENSE
Good job to the bro who made pygame library,(maybe??) because i used it.

(sorry i know it's trash)
